Summary
------
Keeping Kids safe on the Internet was a Vision 100 IT Training night run in November 2016, where we tried to help parents, pastors and ministry workers think about the kind of culture you need to create to keep kids safe on the internet.  Our presenters were Jason Imms and Mike and Christine Jolly, who talked about bullying and other social madness as well as values for internet safety.  After the talks, a very helpful QA session was held to answer questions that people might have had coming into the session.
