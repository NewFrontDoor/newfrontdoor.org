### Contributing to the ongoing work of Vision 100 IT

Vision 100 IT wants to be able to extend its services to more churches, and so we recommend churches contribute an annual amount to keep us running. This isn't a fee, but an opportunity to invest in the common platform of Vision 100 IT.

These are our recommendations, but this is something that we'd discuss with you as you come on board with us, so don't panic!
