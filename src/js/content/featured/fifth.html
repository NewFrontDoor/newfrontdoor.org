<p>
		For our core features and services, we won't invoice you at all. Not in a

		is sort of way, but in a
		<q>We're really eager for you to get the most out of your IT for the good of the Gospel</q>
		sort of way. How does that sound? This is our rationale:
</p>

<p class="lead">
		<blockquote>We want to focus on providing you
				<em>services and methodology</em>
				that will keep you
				<em>engaged with your IT</em>, rather than a product that is merely set and forget. If giving our services to you for free achieves that goal, we'll do it.

</p>

<p>We do have some services that will carry a cost, but we think that if you've got the right people on the ground, and make good use of our documentation, you'll be fine. Some of our products carry a cost as well. For example, our registration payment system utilises Paypal, and does incur minor fees.</p>
<p>*Ironically, our training events do have a cover-charge (see above), but we wanted to stick with the metaphor!</p>
