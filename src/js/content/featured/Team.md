Chris Haines - Team member
Christopher attends Crossroads Presbyterian, and works as the Office Manager for the Network of Christian Reformed Churches of Southern Tasmania, developing policies and procedures for the network of six reformed churches in Kingborough. While he lacks official IT qualifications (he has a Bachelor of Business, majoring in HR), he is passionate about assisting churches practically, and enjoys thinking through the best practices of how churches operate behind the scenes. If you can't get a hold of him on a Monday night, he will most likely be playing Ultimate Frisbee, or cooking up a Gordon Ramsay inspired storm.
