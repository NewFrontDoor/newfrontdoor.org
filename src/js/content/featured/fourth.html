		<div><p>Whether you're already a client, interested in becoming one, or just want some fresh input:</p><p>The events are professional-quality training sessions, with presenters who not only have IT expertise, but have also thought long and hard about how to apply this to the unique context of Christian ministry. Topics range from social media usage to engaging a graphic designer and everything in between.</p></div>
