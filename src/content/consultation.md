title: Consultation
---

The purpose of Vision 100 IT Training and Consultancy is to provide
tailored help to ministry leaders and/or ministry admins using IT in the
service of the mission of their ministry. We long to help ministries
become efficient and effective by doing things in the clearest, easiest
and fastest way possible.

### Who is Vision 100 IT for?

-   Vision 100 IT is part of The Vision 100 Network, a Reformed
    evangelical church planting network in Tasmania.
-   We serve churches from a range of networks: Presbyterian, Christian
    Reformed Church, Baptist, FIEC, Anglican.
-   We require agreement to our simple doctrinal basis from our clients:
    ‘http://vision100.org/beliefs’
-   Our main area of focus is small and medium sized churches (under
    400 people). However we have knowledge and skills to assist larger
    churches too.

Consultation and training framework
-----------------------------------

For some churches, it can simply be more efficient and effective to have
someone on the ground with you as you transition through IT changes.
Meeting with your key staff, stakeholders and your local IT overseer
(from within your church) can make sure that you hit the ground running.

Vision 100 IT offers on-site consultancy anywhere in the country, with
the following time commitments:

-   Initial meeting to clarify needs and expectations (1 hour)
-   3 day on-site visit
-   Post-visit report
-   3 post-visit coaching meetings (1 hour each)

For some churches, onsite is not possible, or is cost prohibitive - but
you’d still like your staff to meet virtually with Vision 100 IT to
ensure that the new tools and expectations are clearly understood.

Vision 100 IT can offer virtual consultancy anywhere in the country,
with the following time commitments:

-   Initial meeting to clarify needs and expectations (1 hour)
-   6 coaching sessions (1 hour each)
-   For smaller churches, smaller parachurch ministries (under 50 adults
    average attendance) and for church plants we can negotiate a lower
    consultancy fee.

### Our consultancy process

In our initial conversation, we seek to discover the context, history,
felt needs and existing strategies of the ministry.

After this initial conversation we cover the following areas, with a
focus on those which are most significant:
-   **Information flow:** the way that information is gathered, updated,
    shared and erased within the ministry. This also includes attention
    to conformity with the Australian Privacy Principles and any
    denominational privacy policies.
-   **Alignment:** the way IT is being used works with rather than
    against your philosophy of ministry, strategy and
    ministry structures.
-   **Integration:** all your IT and other tools working together in the
    most efficient and effective way. Removing any unnecessary steps,
    improving automation.
-   **Training and management processes:** how volunteers and staff are
    equipped to use IT tools and helped over time to continue to use
    them well.
-   **Feature maximisation:** using IT solutions to get the best
    possible advantages from them. Discovering features that are not yet
    being used to their full capacity, using features correctly,
    avoiding unnecessary features.
-   **Communications plan:** how is vision and practical information
    communicated clearly and consistently to staff, leaders, volunteers,
    members and outsiders?
-   **Updating and assessing:** setting to keep new patterns working
    well, and planning to regularly assess and improve.

### Community tools and events

A vital supplement to tailored consultancy is the broader collection of
tools and events that support ministries in their efforts to use IT for
the cause of the gospel.

We have a range of documentation, blog posts and other social media
input to keep ministries growing and developing.

We also run training events, podcasts and webinars to provide input on
general areas of need.

Our community tools also put ministries in touch with others who are
also working at similar challenges, so that they can learn from one
another.
