Podcasting is an excellent way to distribute your church audio, from
your weekly sermons, to your once off evangelistic events and community
seminars. Podcasting allows your church members and others to
\*automatically\* download your audio to their devices.

### Why podcasting is great

The main issue churches have with podcasting is the significant effort
it takes to set it up. Often it’s enough trouble to post the file on the
website. Unfortunately, this then requires church members to regularly
return to the website to download the individual files, and if they then
want to listen on a digital device like a phone or tablet, it needs to
be added to their library, and synced before it can be listened to!

Needless to say - the effort of uploading sermons has a limited impact
when church members find it difficult to listen to them.

This is why Vision 100 IT offers podcasting as a core feature of our
websites. Once set up, it’s as simple as uploading the file to your
website and the rest is handled automatically.

Podcasting can be linked to the iTunes podcasting system as well,
allowing you to use your church branding and to have your church content
discoverable on iTunes.

If you’re interested in having podcasting added to your website, let us
know through the feature request form. If you currently don’t have a
Vision 100 IT hosted website, but are interested in podcasting on your
own page, we’d be happy to let you know what you need to consider in
order to set it up for yourself.
