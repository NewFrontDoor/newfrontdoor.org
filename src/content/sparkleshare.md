Sparkleshare document management
================================

Sparkleshare is a document management system, similar to other cloud
based storage solutions like Dropbox and Google drive. There are a
number of distinctives about Sparkleshare that set it apart from these
other solutions, and which are why we have included it in our Vision 100
IT package.

Hosting
-------

Sparkleshare is an open-source software package, meaning that the core
functionality of the application carries no cost. Although there are
free tiers on other cloud based storage solutions, Sparkleshare is
hosted and maintained by Vision 100 IT on our servers - which puts you
the user in greater control of your storage and brings a number of
benefits:

### 1. Space

The first is space. With commercial solutions, eventually you’ll need
more space, and more space carries a cost. With Sparkleshare, the limit
of storage is the limit of space that Vision 100 IT has on it’s servers
- which are expandable as space is needed. The short of it is that extra
space requirements don’t cost you anything.

### 2. Control and permissions

Dropbox and other free systems are designed for individual use. That is,
you receive your folder within which you can make changes, add extra
folders as you see fit, but ultimately you’re restricted to your one
block of space on the internet. If using it for a ministry, your space
is ultimately ‘owned’ and controlled by the person who set it up.
Sparkleshare functions a little more like a shared drive, where the
space is owned by your Church.

Furthermore, because Sparkleshare is like a shared drive - permissions
for project level access can be defined, added and removed with much
more control than free commercial products, and these features won’t be
tied to corporate tiers which would be overkill both in storage space
and cost for your church.

### 3. Local and shared

Sparkleshare comes with a small application that will keep the files up
to date on your personal computer. This is the primary way that users
will interact with files. When a change is made on one computer, the
other members who have access to that project will automatically receive
the changes.

### 4. Security

Sparkleshare is not account based, but instead is set up with a key that
is unique to your computer. This is an added level of security for a
church that often will be required to store sensitive information about
church members.
