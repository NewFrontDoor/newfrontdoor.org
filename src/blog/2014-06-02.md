Just wanted to keep you updated on some exciting developments for Vision 100 IT, we've now moved all of our websites to the cloud, specifically Amazon EC2 services, which you can now say that your churches/ministries are cloud-hosted.  That should keep you going with geek-cred for at least the next few months ;)

What does it mean?

- From your end, logging in, adding sermons etc., nothing should change, and hopefully you should see no change to the running of your websites.  If you have do have any issues in the next short while, please send us an email at [it@vision100.org](it@vision100.org).
- Things like NBN works cutting cables, servers blowing up etc. will not affect us in the same way they used to, as your websites are hosted in a secure environment with Amazon taking care of power failures etc.  We're also backing up more completely and regularly this way.

Big thanks to all the Vision 100 IT team members 

If you have any questions at all, please let us know at [it@vision100.org](it@vision100.org)
