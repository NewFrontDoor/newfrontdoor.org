In case you hadn't already noticed, it's possible that the wireless microphones you or your church are using are actually illegal, and have been from January 1st.  If you want more information about this, then you can find it here:

It's important to note that you may not need to throw out your equipment, but legally, you should change the frequency for your device.  If you need any help with this, please contact us at <mailto:it@vision100.org> and we can help you with the following:

- Helping you check if your device is transmitting on an illegal frequency
- Help you find out how to retune your device if it's possible
- Give you advice about purchasing new equipment if it is necessary.

Any queries about this, please let us know at <mailto:it@vision100.org>
