Vision 100 IT [website](http://vision100it.org) make a calendar feature available so that your website can make your church members and possible visitors aware of what's coming up.

A few things to bear in mind:

- Make sure that all your events are put on the website. Not only does this build confidence that your webiste has all the information, but it also shows online that your church is active.
- Make sure you have all the relevant details of your event: venue, time (start and end), cost, order of events, registration process (if any). For guest events, it can be helpful to help them know what to expect.
- Make sure you edit events if details change. Probably most people will be aware of the change, but it would be awful for someone to find out about your event online and then turn up at the originally advertised venue even though "everyone" knows that the venue moved.
- Visual images can make an event page on a website all the more striking: so if you have any branding, or even some more generic images, make sure these are added. Talk to <mailto:it@vision100.org> if you need help with graphic design and images.
- Publish your event on all your communication platforms: don't just have your event on your website, or just in your bulletin, or just on Facebook. Make sure that all major events are on all these platforms.
Point people to the website event for more information.

Finally, note that our website calendar feature has a few added benefits:

- You can create recurring events, so you don't need to add them multiple times. You can even have a weekly event that meets every week EXCEPT 2 or 3 particular occasions.
- Your leaders and members can import your website calendar into their iCal or Google Calendar, so you are up to date with what's coming up.
- You can tag events to a particular ministry, so that, for example, the Youth Ministry page on the website can list only those events tagged 'Youth Ministry'
