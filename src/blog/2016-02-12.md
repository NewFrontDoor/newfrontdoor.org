The year has begun! Has your website caught up with that yet?

Out of date or incomplete information on your church website can weaken people's trust in the website... or even in your ministry! So it's worth taking time to check:

- Are staff and leaders who have finished up/started been updated on the website (remember to get good quality photos, not just stealing things off Facebook!)
- Are last year's small groups removed and new ones added?
- Have you added all the major events and preaching series to the website calendar?
- Have you revoked admin privileges (and social media privileges) to leaders who are no longer serving?
