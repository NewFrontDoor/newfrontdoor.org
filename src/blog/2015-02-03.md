As you can probably tell, Vision 100 IT now has it's own special home on the web. If you're not viewing this post in situ, head to [Vision 100 IT](#) and check it out

There are ponies and ice-cream cakes, as well as lots of fairy bread and cocktail sausages there. In fact it's just like a primary school birthday party

There is also a bunch of serious stuff like documentation, feature and support request forms, a blog (which you're reading) and some product page info for you to peruse.

Check it out at [Vision 100 IT website placeholder!](#)
