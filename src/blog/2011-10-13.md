The Vision 100 IT team has recently added the ability to Podcast into our arsenal of tools.

**What does this mean for you?** Everyone is podcasting. It has become a mainstream way of distributing audio and video content, and is definitely something your church members will take advantage of. It’s a great way to keep your member and others who can’t be with you up to speed with your current preaching series.

You can email [it@vision100.org](it@vision100.org) and request the addition of podcasting to your church website. We’ll set it up for you and organise a podcasting account with iTunes on the Apple music store.

**What is Podcasting?** Podcasting is a way that frequent listeners of your sermons online can conveniently download sermon audio as regularly as it’s uploaded to your Church website. It works by providing what is called a feed (notification that the latest sermon has been uploaded) to listeners via iTunes. iTunes can automatically download new sermons available for playing back from a computer, or can be transferred to iPads, iPods and iPhones or another mp3 device to be listened to later.
