Your website uses a special thing called a 'view' to display things. The most obvious example of this is your Calendar View, which displays all your 'Event' content. Views are a quick, relatively automatic way to make sure stuff appears on your website where you want it to. Here are some ways you can use views on your website:

1. Views can replace pages altogether. So rather than creating a page, you can create a type of view called a 'Page View' and then tell it what URL it is to have, and what menu position it is to have. [For example](https://ufcutas.org/Resources/General)
1. Views can also be displayed as a part of page, by typing '' (x=name of the view). [For example, 'Latest Sermon' here](https://ufcutas.org/resources/sermons)
1. Views can also be created as 'Blocks' so that you can put them in in a particular spot on another web page (like a sidebar). [For example, both the calendar in the right sidebar and the sermons in the left sidebar here](https://ufcutas.org/romans)


More information about Views, including how you can create a page that displays all the sermons, dates and Bible studies for a sermon series can be found in Guidelines for Adding and Editing Content [here](https://vision100.org/ITdocs).
