When you are planning the flier and poster design for your upcoming conferences and evangelistic missions, make sure you give a full design brief to the person who will be doing your posters. Don't just ask for a flier and a poster but also request:

- Facebook icon
- Website banner to run along the bottom of your website page
- Website button to link to the main event page from your front page or sidebar
- Organise someone to take photos that you can post on Facebook afterwards
