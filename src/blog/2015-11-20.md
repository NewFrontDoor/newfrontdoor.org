As a team helping small churches without the funds to do high quality photography, we're always on the lookout for high quality images that churches can use for their sermon series backgrounds or camp brochures or website backgrounds.

Sources like [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) often are hard to search through and just using Google Image Search can often lead to you unwittingly breaking copyright law as these are not considered fair use exemptions.

Unsplash is a great resource for visual imagery, particularly as it focuses on nature photography, and all images on the site are high resolution and able to be used for whatever you want. We're particularly impressed by the fact that these images often leave plenty of space to put text (like Sermon Series titles), so it's well worth a look.
